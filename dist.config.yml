# iceBT Configuration File
#
# This configuration is used as part of the ./icebt commands in order to build
# the stack. The majority of these settings (ports, version numbers) will not
# need to be changed.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file must be indented using 4 spaces. Failing to do so will
# result in bash parsing errors and failed builds. Nobody wants that.
#
# IMPORTANT: Initialise this file.
# Recommended method: ./icebt config-init
# Alternative method: duplicate this file, save as config.yml
#
# IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to rebuild any built serivce after
# changing any of these configuration values.
# Services can be rebuilt using: ./icebt rebuild [SERVICE_NAME]
# If no [SERVICE_NAME] is provided all services will be rebuilt
#
# todo: look into passing indent length to arguments
# todo: add iceMika configuration values
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Administration Configuration
#
# The username password combination provided here can be used to access the
# following services:
# - mysql (superuser for the mysql database defined)
# - phpmyadmin (manage the defined mysql database only)
# - phpredmin
# - postgres (superuser for the postgres database defined)
# - pgweb
# - redis (database password)
#
# The username password combination provided here will be the mysql account
# details used in the iceMika connection to the mysql database. Read the MySql
# configuration comments for implications of changing these details post build.
#
# The username password combination provided here will be the postgres account
# details used. Read the postgres configuration comments for implications of
# changing these details post build.
#
# The password provided here will be used as the redis database password. Read
# the redis configuration comments for implications of changing these details
# post build.
#
# username:
#     The username to use for the administration account
# password:
#     The password to use for the administration account.
admin:
    username: admin
    password: admin

# Composer Configuration
#
# version:
#     The version of composer to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/composer
# command:
#     The composer command to run on initialisation
#     This command will be responsible for building the iceWeb package.
#     Commands listed here: https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md
#     Recommended production value: install
composer:
    version: latest
    command: install -v

# Memcached Configuration
#
# version:
#     The version of memcached to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/memcached
# port:
#     The port this service will be exposed to on the host machine.
#     This does not affect the internal port 11211 which is used regardless.
# memory_limit:
#     The amount of memory allocated to memcached for object storage.
#     Value provided should be an integer representation of the megabytes to
#     allocate.
# connection_limit
#     The maximum number of simultaneous connections to the memcached service.
# threads:
#     Specify the number of threads to use when processing incoming requests.
#     The threading improves the performance of storing and retrieving data in
#     the cache, using a locking system to prevent different threads overwriting
#     or updating the same values
# max_requests_per_event:
#     The maximum number of requests per event process.
# listen_backlog:
#     The backlog queue limit.
#     The backlog queue configures how many network connections can be waiting
#     to be processed by memcached. Increasing this limit may reduce errors
#     received by the client that it is not able to connect to the memcached
#     instance, but does not improve the performance of the server.
# max_item_size:
#     Specify the maximum size permitted for storing an object within the
#     memcached instance. The size supports a unit postfix
#     (k for kilobytes, m for megabytes).
memcached:
    version: 1-alpine
    port: 11211
    memory_limit: 64
    connection_limit: 1024
    threads: 4
    max_requests_per_event: 20
    listen_backlog: 1024
    max_item_size: 1m

# MySQL Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the mysql data volume, root passwords, admin
# account details and databases will only be created on the initial volume
# build. That is the first time the iceBT stack is built. Changes to these
# account details made after the first build will have to be executed manually.
# This is the same for the database user created with the admin username and
# password. Even if the details are changed manually the changes must be
# reflected within this file. If they are not, service links requiring database
# credentials (for example iceMika needing a database username and password
# [admin username, password]) may not be able to connect properly and will fail.
#

#     The MySql version to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.

# PostgreSQL Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the postgresql data volume, the database,
# username (set in admin) and password (set in admin) will only be created on
# the initial volume build. That is the first time the iceBT stack is built.
# Changes to these details made after the first build will have to be executed
# manually. This is the same for the database user created with the admin
# username and password. Even if the details are changed manually the changes
# must be reflected within this file. If they are not, service links requiring
# database credentials (for example the pgweb service that connects via a
# postgres database url built using values set here) may not be able to connect
# properly and will fail.
#
# version:
#     The version of PostgreSQL to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.

    database: iceBT

# Redis Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the redis data volume, the redis password
# (set in admin) will only be set on the initial volume build. That is the first
# time the iceBT stack is built. Changes to the admin password made after the
# initial redis build will have to be executed manually. They will not be
# automatically updated on a restart, rebuild of this service. If an admin
# password is required to be changed ensure this configuration file is updated
# to reflect that change. If it is not, service links requiring the redis
# password (phpredmin for example) may not be able to connect properly and will
# fail.
#
# version:
#     The version of Redis to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/redis
# port:

#     IMPORTANT:
#     Do not change this value in a running environment.
#     Do not manually create this value.
#     This value should have been populated as part of the config initialisation
#     command (./icebt config-init) if it has not been populated run the
#     following command: ./icebt sentry create-secret. Alternatively if you
#     have not already done so, run the ./icebt config-init command.
