# iceBT Configuration File
#
# This configuration is used as part of the ./icebt commands in order to build
# the stack. The majority of these settings (ports, version numbers) will not
# need to be changed.
#
# IMPORTANT: This file must be indented using 4 spaces. Failing to do so will
# result in bash parsing errors and failed builds. Nobody wants that.
#
# IMPORTANT: Initialise this file.
# Recommended method: ./icebt config-init
# Alternative method: duplicate this file, save as config.yml
#
# IMPORTANT: It is strongly recommended to rebuild any built serivce after
# changing any of these configuration values.
# Services can be rebuilt using: ./icebt rebuild [SERVICE_NAME]
# If no [SERVICE_NAME] is provided all services will be rebuilt
#
# todo: look into passing indent length to arguments
# todo: add iceMika configuration values
# # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # # #

# Administration Configuration
#
# The username password combination provided here can be used to access the
# following services:
# - mysql (superuser for the mysql database defined)
# - phpmyadmin (manage the defined mysql database only)
# - phpredmin
# - postgres (superuser for the postgres database defined)
# - pgweb
# - redis (database password)
#
# The username password combination provided here will be the mysql account
# details used in the iceMika connection to the mysql database. Read the MySql
# configuration comments for implications of changing these details post build.
#
# The username password combination provided here will be the postgres account
# details used. Read the postgres configuration comments for implications of
# changing these details post build.
#
# The password provided here will be used as the redis database password. Read
# the redis configuration comments for implications of changing these details
# post build.
#
# username:
#     The username to use for the administration account
# password:
#     The password to use for the administration account.
admin:
    username: admin
    password: admin

# Composer Configuration
#
# version:
#     The version of composer to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/composer
# command:
#     The composer command to run on initialisation
#     This command will be responsible for building the iceWeb package.
#     Commands listed here: https://getcomposer.org/doc/03-cli.md
#     Recommended production value: install
composer:
    version: latest
    command: install -v

# MySQL Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the mysql data volume, root passwords, admin
# account details and databases will only be created on the initial volume
# build. That is the first time the iceBT stack is built. Changes to these
# account details made after the first build will have to be executed manually.
# This is the same for the database user created with the admin username and
# password. Even if the details are changed manually the changes must be
# reflected within this file. If they are not, service links requiring database
# credentials (for example iceMika needing a database username and password
# [admin username, password]) may not be able to connect properly and will fail.
#
# version:
#     The MySql version to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/mysql
# port:

#     This does not affect the internal port 3306 which is used regardless.

# root_password:
#     The name of the password used for the root account of the mysql instance.

# PostgreSQL Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the postgresql data volume, the database,
# username (set in admin) and password (set in admin) will only be created on
# the initial volume build. That is the first time the iceBT stack is built.
# Changes to these details made after the first build will have to be executed
# manually. This is the same for the database user created with the admin
# username and password. Even if the details are changed manually the changes
# must be reflected within this file. If they are not, service links requiring
# database credentials (for example the pgweb service that connects via a
# postgres database url built using values set here) may not be able to connect
# properly and will fail.
#
# version:
#     The version of PostgreSQL to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/postgres

#     This database will be accessible using the username and password set in
#     the admin section of this configuration file.

# Redis Configuration
#
# IMPORTANT: Due to limitations in the redis data volume, the redis password
# (set in admin) will only be set on the initial volume build. That is the first
# time the iceBT stack is built. Changes to the admin password made after the
# initial redis build will have to be executed manually. They will not be
# automatically updated on a restart, rebuild of this service. If an admin
# password is required to be changed ensure this configuration file is updated
# to reflect that change. If it is not, service links requiring the redis
# password (phpredmin for example) may not be able to connect properly and will
# fail.
#
# version:
#     The version of Redis to use.
#     A Docker image tag should be provided.
#     Tags: https://store.docker.com/images/redis
# port:
