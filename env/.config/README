DO NOT EDIT THE FILES WITHIN THIS DIRECTORY.

Configuration values should not be set directly in the files within this
directory. They are tokenized boilerplate configuration files which are
populated with the values set in config.yml when iceBT commands have been run
that trigger a build/start of the iceBT stack. To change the values used in
these configuration files update the configuration values in config.yml

EXCEPTION: There is one exception to this rule, (which at the time of writing
is) nginx.conf.dist. This file may be duplicated (save as nginx.conf) and
updated as required. It is not recommended to change the server root, this will
have major implications and result in failed iceBT builds.
